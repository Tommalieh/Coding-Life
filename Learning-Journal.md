# Read:02 Summary

#### After reading the resources provider in read: 02 i've learened the following:

1. A **terminal** is a non-graphical method to manage and move around an operating system
2. A **shell** is the behaviour of the outputs of the terminal, *different shells have different behaviours*
3. Use shortcuts whenever possible as they are great at **saving time** and **effort**
4. Knowing how to manage your directory and change where you at using different methods is the **essence** of using the terminal **effeciently**
5. The difference between the **command line** and it's **options** and **arguments*
6. Everything is a file and linux is an **extensionless OS** and also **case sensitive**
