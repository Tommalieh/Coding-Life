# Maintain a Growth Mindset
### A Self Reminder

#### Why?!

We always have dreams and aspires to acheive and with big dreams come big challenges and sometimes you feel like you can't keep going and you feel like giving up, but if you build and maintain a growth mindset you'll be able to overcome these challenges and jump to higher level.

#### How?!

1- **Do it one step at a time**
  - *Whenever you're facing a challenging topic try to part it into smaller tasks where it becomes easier.*
  
2- **Don't giveup**
  - *Keep pushing yourself beyond your limits.*
  
3- **Turntables**
  - *When you face criticism use it to know where your weakness was and turn it to a quality of yours.*
